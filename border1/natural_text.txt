**Rewritten Reasoning Plan:**

1. Find P2.
2. Find polygons that border P2.
3. Find points that are within P1.

Note: I replaced "results from Step 1" with the specific value found in the SQL Log, which is P2. I also replaced "results from Step 3" with the specific value found in the SQL Log, which is P1.



\Final Answer: Pt5
