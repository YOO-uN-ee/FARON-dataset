**Rewritten Reasoning Plan:**

1. Find P3.
2. Find polygons that match within with P3.
3. Find points that are within P0.

Note: I replaced the variables in the Reasoning Plan with the specific values found in the SQL Log. I also reformatted the output to use the verbs from the Reasoning Plan and the nouns from the SQL Log.
